    wordOfMouth: 'customers-referring'
  },

  // Less outbound needed
  outbound: {
    volume: 'reduce-to-500-per-month',

```

## Competitive Advantages of Solo + AI

### 1. Speed
```
Funded startup:
- Product decision → discuss with team → consensus → ship
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks

Solo + AI:
- Product decision → ship
- Timeline: Same day

Result: 10-20x faster iteration
```

### 2. Focus
```
Funded startup:
- 40% managing team
- 30% coordinating execution
- 20% fundraising/reporting
- 10% actual building

Solo + AI:
- 0% managing team
- 0% coordinating (AI executes)
- 0% fundraising
- 100% building and strategy

Result: 10x more focused time
```

### 3. Economics
```
Funded startup to $1M ARR:
- Burn: $250K/month
- Time: 24 months
- Total spent: $6M
- Dilution: 30-40%
- Founder take-home: $1.8-2.1M (at 3x exit)

Solo + AI to $1M ARR:
- Burn: $5K/month
- Time: 18 months
- Total spent: $90K
- Dilution: 0%
- Founder take-home: $3M (at 3x exit) + $500K in profit along the way

Result: 2x more founder wealth
```

### 4. Resilience
```
Funded startup:
- Runs out of cash → dies
- Market downturn → can't raise → dies
- Slow growth → investors lose confidence → dies

Solo + AI:
- Profitable → infinite runway
- Market downturn → stays profitable
- Slow growth → still profitable, patient iteration

Result: Survives where funded startups die
```

## Real Solo Founder Examples

### Example 1: Developer Tools SaaS

**Founder:** Solo technical founder
**Product:** AI code review tool
**Competition:** 3 funded startups ($5M-$15M raised each)

**Approach:**
- AI generates 60 blog posts/month on code quality topics
- AI runs LinkedIn engagement (200 comments/week on developer posts)
- AI handles outbound to CTOs (400 emails/month)
- Founder does product + demos only

**Month 6 Results:**
- Customers: 147 ($47/month avg)
- MRR: $6,909
- Profitable
- Organic ranking: #1 for 23 keywords
- Social: 8,400 followers (vs competitor's 1,200)

**Funded Competitor:**
- Customers: 89
- MRR: $15,800 (higher ACV, fewer customers)
- Burning $300K/month
- Recently laid off 5 people

**Winner:** Solo founder (profitable, growing faster, more resilient)

### Example 2: Sales Automation

**Founder:** Non-technical solo founder (used no-code + sales-builder)
**Product:** CRM for freelancers
**Competition:** HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive

**Approach:**
- AI creates video tutorials (8/month)
- AI writes comparison content ("vs HubSpot" etc)
- AI runs TikTok account (daily posts)
- AI handles freemium onboarding
- Founder does customer success for paid only

**Month 9 Results:**
- Freemium users: 2,847
- Paid customers: 142 ($79/month avg)
- MRR: $11,218
- Profitable since month 5
- TikTok: 47K followers
- Comparison pages rank #1 vs all competitors

**Funded Competitors:**
- Can't compete on price ($79 vs $450+)
- Can't compete on content volume (8 videos/month vs their quarterly)
- Can't compete on social (47K vs their 4K followers)

**Winner:** Solo founder (owns profitable niche)

## The Solo Founder's Unfair Advantages

### 1. Lower CAC = Target Smaller Customers

```
Funded startup:
- CAC: $8,000
- Must target: $50K+ ACV deals
- Addressable market: Limited to enterprises

Solo + AI:
- CAC: $400
- Can target: $1K+ ACV deals
- Addressable market: 100x larger
```

### 2. Infinite Patience

```
Funded startup:
- Investors want 10x in 5 years
- Must grow fast or die
- Pressure to raise more, hire more, burn more

Solo + AI:
- No investors
- Can grow at sustainable pace
- Profitable = infinite runway = patient capital
```

### 3. Lean Pivots

```
Funded startup:
- Pivot requires board approval
- Must justify to investors
- Team morale risk
- 3-6 months to execute

Solo + AI:
- Pivot decision made over coffee
- Reconfigure AI agents same day
- Test new direction immediately
- 1 week to fully pivot
```

    'need-to-outspend-competitor-immediately',
    'regulation-requires-capitalization',
    'want-to-scale-team-for-speed'
  ],

  // Most solo founders should NOT raise
  recommendation: {
    default: 'stay-solo-and-profitable',
    raiseMaybe: 'only-if-strategic-necessity',
    raiseNever: 'if-just-because-everyone-else-does'
  }
}
```

2. Generate 50+ posts in month 1
3. Start outbound to 500 prospects
