## Problem

<Section variant="problem">

### The Founder's Dilemma

You have two choices:

1. **Focus on product** — But growth stalls and competitors overtake you
2. **Focus on sales** — But product quality suffers and users churn

Either way, you lose.

The reality:

- **Content marketing** requires consistent publishing
- **Social presence** demands daily engagement
- **Outbound sales** needs persistent follow-up
- **Lead nurturing** takes weeks of touchpoints
- **Video content** requires production skills

One person can't do it all. But hiring a team is expensive.

## Solution

### What If Sales Ran Itself?

```typescript
import { Sales } from 'sales-builder'

const sales = Sales.create({
  product: 'MyStartup',
  icp: 'technical-founders'
})

// One command. All channels.
await sales.start({
  content: { frequency: '3x/week' },
  social: { frequency: 'daily' },
  outbound: { volume: 50, cadence: 'weekly' },
  video: { frequency: 'weekly' }
})

// Wake up to new leads.
```

Define your growth strategy. We execute it 24/7.

## FAQ

<FAQ
  items={[
    {
      question: "How does AI-generated content maintain quality?",
      answer: "We use advanced AI models trained on high-performing content. You can set brand voice guidelines, review before publishing, or let it run fully autonomous. Most users start with review mode and move to autonomous as they see the quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Will outbound emails land in spam?",
      answer: "We follow email best practices—proper warmup, personalization, sending limits, and reputation management. Our deliverability rates consistently exceed 95%."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I connect my existing tools?",
      answer: "Yes. Sales Builder integrates with major CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce), email providers (Gmail, Outlook), social platforms, and analytics tools. Data flows both ways."
    },
    {
      question: "What's AEO (AI Engine Optimization)?",
      answer: "AEO optimizes your content to appear in AI-powered search results—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc. As more people use AI for research, AEO becomes as important as traditional SEO."
    },
    {
      question: "How do funnels work with my existing sales process?",
      answer: "Funnels handle automated nurturing and handoff qualified leads to your team (or calendar). You define the qualification criteria and handoff triggers. The AI handles everything up to that point."
