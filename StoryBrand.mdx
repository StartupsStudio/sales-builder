# StoryBrand Framework: Sales Builder

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Founder, Solopreneur, or Growth Lead who needs to drive sales without building a sales team.

**What do they want?**

- Launch products that get noticed
- Generate consistent inbound leads
- Run outbound campaigns without manual effort
- Convert prospects through automated nurturing
- Scale growth across every channel simultaneously

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)

"I need to be everywhere—blogging, tweeting, emailing, making videos, responding to leads—but I'm just one person with 24 hours in a day."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)

"Sales feels overwhelming. I'm a builder, not a salesperson. Every hour spent on outreach is an hour not spent on product."

### Philosophical Problem

In the age of AI, founders shouldn't have to choose between building and selling. Growth should be as programmable as infrastructure.

### The Villain

**Manual Sales Processes** — The endless cycle of writing content, scheduling posts, sending emails, following up, and tracking leads that burns out founders and limits growth.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built autonomous workflows that handle every aspect of sales and growth so founders can focus on building.

**Empathy:** We've been founders too. We know the pain of juggling product development with the constant pressure to generate revenue.

**Authority:**

- Unified API for all sales and growth channels
- Battle-tested workflows powering Startups.Studio portfolio
- Integration with api.sb and db.sb for seamless data management
- AI-native architecture built on primitives.org.ai

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Launch

Start with a launch that gets attention—Product Hunt, social announcements, email to your list.

```typescript
import { Launch } from 'sales-builder'

const launch = Launch.create({
  product: 'MyStartup',
  date: '2024-03-01',
  channels: ['producthunt', 'twitter', 'linkedin', 'email']
})

await launch.execute()
```

### Step 2: Attract

Build consistent inbound through content, SEO/AEO, and social presence.

```typescript
import { Content, SEO, Social } from 'sales-builder'

// Blog posts, optimized for AI search
await Content.generate({
  type: 'blog',
  topic: 'How to solve {problem}',
  seo: true,
  aeo: true  // AI Engine Optimization
})

// Social engagement
await Social.engage({
  platforms: ['twitter', 'linkedin'],
  style: 'helpful',
  frequency: 'daily'
})
```

### Step 3: Convert

Nurture prospects through automated funnels and personalized outreach.

```typescript
import { Funnel, Outbound } from 'sales-builder'

const funnel = Funnel.create({
  name: 'trial-to-paid',
  stages: ['awareness', 'interest', 'trial', 'conversion'],
  automation: true
})

await Outbound.campaign({
  target: 'icp-matches',
  channels: ['email', 'linkedin'],
  sequence: ['intro', 'value', 'social-proof', 'offer']
})
```

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Start Selling → `npx sales-builder init`

**Transitional CTA:** See the workflows at api.sb/sales

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**

- Launch with impact across multiple channels simultaneously
- Wake up to inbound leads from content published while you slept
- Consistent pipeline growth without manual outreach
- Convert prospects through intelligent, personalized nurturing
- Scale revenue while staying focused on product

**Transformation:**

From: Spending half your time on sales activities
To: Sales running autonomously while you build

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**

- Great products that nobody knows about
- Founders burned out from manual sales work
- Inconsistent growth that stalls when you focus on product
- Lost leads from slow follow-up
- Competitors winning because they ship and sell faster

## 8. Brand Identity

**Voice:** Empowering, practical, growth-focused

**Tone:** Confident, supportive, results-oriented

**Key Messages:**

1. "Growth-as-Code. Sales on autopilot."
2. "Every channel. One API. Zero manual work."
3. "Build your product. We'll build your pipeline."
